# Project Configuration

This is a fresh project set up with the Breakthrough System:

## Available Tools
- **Dev Team 1**: Competitive AI orchestration for complex problems
- **Escalation Protocol**: 3-attempt rule before escalating to dev_team_inbox/
- **Solution Delivery**: Cascading ranked solutions in final_solution/

## Project Structure
- `dev_team_inbox/` - Problem escalations
- `final_solution/` - Ranked solutions from Dev Team 1
- `problem_tracking/` - Learning system for resolved problems

## Current Status
- Dev Team 1 monitor: Active
- API connections: Verified
- Ready for development

## Getting Started
Start building your project. When Claude Code encounters complex problems that require 3+ attempts, they will automatically escalate to Dev Team 1 for competitive multi-AI analysis.

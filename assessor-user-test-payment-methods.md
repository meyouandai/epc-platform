## Test Scenarios & Results

### Scenario 1: First-Time Payment Method Setup

**Task**: New assessor adds their first payment method

#### Sarah's Experience (Veteran, Low Tech)
```
Navigation: Overview ‚Üí Payment Methods tab
Time: 45 seconds to find tab

Initial Reaction:
"I need to add a payment method... oh there's a big blue button"
*clicks "Add Payment Method"*

Modal Experience:
"This says it's just a demo... that's confusing. Am I actually adding
a real card? The button says 'Add Method' but I haven't entered anything."

ISSUES IDENTIFIED:
- Demo message creates uncertainty about real functionality
- No actual form fields visible in current implementation
- "Add Method" button misleading when no data entered
```

#### David's Experience (Independent, Moderate Tech)
```
Navigation: Direct to Payment Methods tab
Time: 15 seconds

Initial Reaction:
"Clean interface. I can see this is where I manage payment methods."
*clicks "Add Payment Method"*

Modal Experience:
"Ah, it's a demo. That makes sense for testing. In real use, I'd expect
to see card form fields here - number, expiry, CVV, billing address."

SUGGESTIONS:
- Modal should show placeholder form fields even in demo mode
- Needs clear indication of required vs optional fields
```

#### Emma's Experience (Tech-Savvy, Mobile)
```
Device: iPhone 14
Navigation: Swipes to Payment Methods tab
Time: 8 seconds

Initial Reaction:
"Mobile view looks good. Payment method cards are well-sized for touch."
*taps "Add Payment Method"*

Modal Experience:
"Modal works well on mobile. Good that it doesn't close when I tap inside.
Would expect form fields and maybe Apple Pay integration here."

MOBILE-SPECIFIC NOTES:
- Modal is appropriately sized for mobile
- Touch targets are adequate (44px+)
- Would benefit from mobile payment options (Apple Pay, Google Pay)
```

### Scenario 2: Managing Multiple Payment Methods

**Task**: User with existing methods wants to change default and remove old card

#### Sarah's Experience
```
Current State: Has 2 cards (Visa default, MasterCard backup)
Goal: Remove the MasterCard, keep Visa as default

Actions Taken:
1. Reviews both payment method cards
2. Notes Visa is marked "Default"
3. Clicks "Remove" on MasterCard
   *MasterCard disappears immediately*

Reaction:
"That was easy. Maybe too easy? I didn't get asked if I was sure.
What if I clicked the wrong button?"

ISSUES IDENTIFIED:
- No confirmation dialog for payment method removal
- No undo functionality
- Could accidentally remove wrong method
```

#### David's Experience
```
Current State: Has 2 cards, wants to switch default
Goal: Change default from Visa to MasterCard

Actions Taken:
1. Clicks "Set as Default" on MasterCard
2. Interface updates immediately
3. Visa no longer shows "Default", MasterCard now does

Reaction:
"Good, that worked as expected. The default badge updating immediately
gives good feedback. Would be nice to see a brief success message."

FEEDBACK:
- Immediate visual feedback is good
- Could benefit from subtle success indication
- Consider showing when the new default will take effect
```

#### Emma's Experience (Mobile)
```
Current State: Has 2 cards, testing removal on mobile
Device: iPhone 14

Actions Taken:
1. Taps "Remove" on second card
   *Card disappears immediately*

Reaction:
"That happened very fast. On mobile, accidental taps are more common.
Definitely needs a 'Are you sure?' dialog, especially since there's
no way to undo this action."

MOBILE CONSIDERATIONS:
- Higher risk of accidental taps on mobile
- Should implement swipe-to-delete pattern
- Confirmation dialogs more critical on touch devices
```

---

### Scenario 3: Empty State Experience

**Task**: New user sees payment methods tab with no existing methods

#### All Users Experienced:
```
Empty State Elements:
- Card icon (üí≥)
- "No Payment Methods" heading
- "Add a payment method to start receiving leads" description
- "Add Your First Payment Method" button

Universal Feedback:
- Clear call-to-action
- Explains consequence of not having payment method
- Consistent with overall design language
- Button text could be shorter on mobile
```

---

### Scenario 4: Error Handling & Edge Cases

#### Expired Card Scenario
**Current Implementation**: Shows expiry date but no warnings
```
David's Feedback:
"I can see my card expires 08/2025, but there's no indication that
it's expiring soon. In 6 months, will I get a warning? Should I
proactively update it now?"

RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Add expiry warning indicators (30/60/90 days out)
- Email notifications for upcoming expirations
- Auto-pause lead purchasing if all cards expired
```

#### Single Payment Method Removal
**Current Implementation**: Remove button is disabled for default methods
```
Sarah's Confusion:
"The Remove button is grayed out on my only card. I understand why,
but there's no explanation. What if I want to stop using the service?"

IMPROVEMENTS NEEDED:
- Tooltip explaining why remove is disabled
- Alternative action: "Pause Account" or "Deactivate Billing"
- Clear explanation of consequences
```

## Specific Recommendations

### Immediate Fixes
1. **Add confirmation dialog for removal**
   ```
   "Remove VISA ‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢ 4532?

   This payment method will no longer be available for billing.
   Any pending charges will use your default payment method.

   [Cancel] [Remove Payment Method]"
   ```

2. **Improve demo modal with form fields**
   ```
   Card Number: [4532 ‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢ ‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢ ‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢] (Demo)
   Expiry: [MM/YY] CVV: [‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢]

   Note: This is a demo environment. Real card data
   would be securely processed here.
   ```

3. **Add expiry warnings**
   ```
   VISA ‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢ 4532
   Expires 02/2025 ‚ö†Ô∏è Expires in 3 months
   ```

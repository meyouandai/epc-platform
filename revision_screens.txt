hello okay so yeah this is the login screen that you created for us
um straight away you can see that it's not got our logo uh company's not epc certificates online
um it is your local surveyor so if possible what i need to do is change
that over but what i've done as well is i've got a word document that i'm going to send you as well
so you'll have the video um screen recording but then you'll also have this word document
so you can kind of go along and see um what i meant by the things that i'm saying so yep for
this one what it's got is company logo isn't ours so it needs our company logo and it also needs to
be a bit more modern it looks outdated i'd say so i've attached a um a screenshot of another website
so i'm not saying copy this design but i'm just giving you as a guiding guidelines for you to see
what kind of login screen we're looking for rather than being a basic one where it to be a bit more
modern a bit more up-to-date a bit more um nicer aesthetics so what i'd say as well is we also need
a page for agents to create an account so currently there isn't anywhere for them to do that so we need
to have a page where they can do that and i'm not too sure if it would be on this part or if it would be
a total separate page um i think a separate page would make sense and it's just a link that i can give
people or there could be a link on the website and that takes into like a registration form rather than
a login form so yeah that's what i'm thinking to do that makes more sense so the form will just have
these in here so you'll have the word document later on and you will um this is what they would be
entering in so their first name last name etc and then they'll create um or sorry set a password and
then create an account but the issue is once they complete it they need to receive a message to thank
them saying that they will be granted access to the platform shortly so we're the ones that will
approve them um after they've sent their documents etc so anyway yeah so that's sorted there
so i'm going to log in and just show you quickly so what we've got here is we've got the navigation menu
um i wanted to make some changes over there so we want the company logo instead of happily
and then i want the pages to be in the following order so we've got dashboards agents coverage leads
payments profile and then create account i think the only difference here was i wanted to switch
payments around with profile and then i wanted to add the create account page underneath so scrolling
down now what we've got is the dashboard so here we've got the dashboard that you created with the
metrics however it was okay but i wanted to be a little bit more um provide a little bit more insights
from the data that we already have so on here we can see what we've got just square metric cards
and we've got total leads total revenue total overdue new assessors active assessors and total districts
i'm just going to show you over here actually how it looks so the um cards don't need to be this big
to be honest um you can make them so much smaller so it's literally could just be like that big um
and then we've got the period so we can change the period just to see
the different leads we've had the total revenue we've had how much is overdue how much new assessors
have come on board how many assessors we currently have and how many districts we've currently have so
the data that you were doing for us um getting that was already there so it's not extra work and
what i would say is just remove the coverage alerts as well so we don't need the coverage alerts or the
payment alerts and again i put these notes in here just so you can see and what else have i said
um admin profile we don't need a photo and we don't need um the full screen button so you can remove that
okay so now we're going to move on to the agent screen so on the agent screen this is
where we can search for the different agents so we come on the page you can see um
nothing will be showing until we search for an agent so there's no reason for us to just be looking
at agents unless we want to come over here click new and then start um
sorry click pending and then start looking at the people who are pending for us to go in and approve
so we need to be able to come in here and then click approve so i've not created the button to do that
yet because i wasn't sure how we would connect it i don't know what database that goes in or how that works
so if you can just clear that up um so yeah anyway what we've got on this page is the um
we would have the agent search results from when we typed in the name so let's say we typed in drew
drew would then pop up you could then see drew's details phone number company name email how long
he's been a member the areas that he's covering lead statistics billing outstanding um his due date
and when he's last paid or sorry what he last paid so those are those deals that we want here edit
details will take us over into drew's profile where we can make any edits that we need payment history
will show us any payments that he's made and then deactivate account would be if he is no longer um
paying us to be a member same again with the other people in the list we can see same details again
we've got these buttons here to click and then here we can see the status of the agent so we can see
that dawn is inactive we've manually made her and deactivated her account she might now want to
come back we're not too sure why he left yet could be because of money could because she wasn't paying
and now she's paid the bill so yeah we can go in and activate her account and then that should start
um that should allow her to now get access back to her account for her to start selecting the postcodes
that she wants to um what do you call it she wants to be shown in so what we've got there we're going
to try and get through this as quick as possible we've got coverages the coverages is quite straightforward
similar to how it is with the um postcode search page what we've got is you come on here you've got
the categories so you've got the county level then you've got the city level and then in each city
level we can see how many assessors we've got in each one pretty straightforward don't think i need
to explain more of that one we've got the color key here in the word document so we don't need the
color key on the page it's just for you to kind of understand what each of the color um codes meant
or color keys meant okay so what we've got next we've got the leads so here this is the leads one
for the admin dashboard um admin portal so we can come in here and we can search leads so let's say
we have a name called john john should pop up now we have to search it okay so we can search it and
then see the leads we can also remove a lead if it's a fake lead um if you wanted to just have a quick
browse we can come in here and see top postcodes in a um city or city area like london you can see
how many of these they've got you can see these cover indicators as they will let us know
how many assessors we've got if you've got four assessors it would be full coverage if we've got
two to three it will be needs coverage and if we've got one it will say urgent we've also got the
trend data showing us what the um increase was from the leads that we had the day before
obviously we can change the period and those would be reflective of what the amount was versus the
periods that we selected you can also come down to the actual leads that are coming in you can see the
dates that they came in the most recent will be at the top the postcode district that it came in will
be here and then we can also see these um indicators or circles which indicate how many assessors the
leads got sent to yes we do want four assessors to be there all the time however there may be some
points in time when we are when we don't have four so what do we do do we turn them off maybe not we
might still run them with two people and see what we can do um we can click on an actual lead and then
you can see the full address of the um person who searched the contact number and then you can see
who was assigned to get the lead so we've got two assessors there that matches that if we click on one
before we should have four assessors so we can easily see that that has four assessors it would have their
names and that is basically that one
so what we've got next let me just make sure lead coverage and we also mean to delete fake leads so
please can you add a delete lead button which updates the assessor if you've received it and paid
so yeah so what i'm saying is when you click on here you should have like a delete lead button and then a
confirmation after you click it saying are you sure you want to delete this lead and then with a box to
give a reason so we are kind of making sure that we're not clicking accidentally and then when we
are going to delete it we are putting in a valid reason okay so what we've got next we've got payment
screen so over here this is the admin payment screen you can see total due that's how much we are due to
come in for from the last 30 days total paid this is how much has been paid in the last 30 we've got
active invoices this is for people who haven't reached their threshold or haven't had their
invoice period come to an end yet and then we've got overdue amounts and we also can see how many
invoices this amounts made up of so this is quite useful for us because it helps us to have a quick
snapshot of everything and see what's going on um
down the page we've got quick filters so if you just want to see who's active we can just click
that and it should just show who's active if you want to see due we can just see who's due if you
want to see overdue you can just see overdue and paid you can see just paid so i think what we want
is for these to only show for the last 30 days i think and then they get archived because i think if
we're going to be having so much invoices for people it's just going to get clogged up over here
if you have it in this kind of um higher level format whereas if you just have it in the basic raw data
as basic as possible can be similar to how kind of these forms were to be honest you know this these
kind of data is really just raw data not really much going on just some tables um and then what
i'm saying is after 30 to 60 days um i would like to move over the invoices over there and then if i
want to view them i can go and click view archive and that's where they would be okay
so what we've got anyway so yeah let me just explain here so we've got the invoice we can click
on the invoice so we can click on the invoice and we can go and see what's on the invoice we can also
go and click on the assessor name and that would take over take us over to their um agent profile
um we can see the threshold and then we can see the status of when it was paid and the status to
quickly show that it has been paid we've got other people who haven't reached the threshold so that's
where the shown is active we've got um somebody who's due to make a payment that's why they're in
orange sorry yellow and we can also tick here so then click paid and that will update and go in green
and then we've also got um this one here they're overdue they're due to make the payment on the 26th
i haven't made it yet um however they've made it today and now i can go and pay it sorry select it
as paid so that's that one sorted as well um what we've got next
okay so we've got admin profile so admin profile quick pretty straightforward don't really need
much first name last name email address and then and the just then just then the option to
update our password if we need to so that's quite straightforward
make sure i'm adding anything right okay so now we've got the create account page this is the page
for the admin to create an account for other admins and agents so here you can see admin if i wanted
to create a user john smith email address password and that's one also i wanted to add these so you can
see the password that you're typing in and i want it to when i click one it then opens or makes both of
the boxes visible okay then you've got the assessor page similar kind of page just different fields that
need to be entered in for the assessor this one you'd enter in there company name as optional phone number
accreditation number accreditation company and that would be that okay and then even when we create
the account for agents they don't immediately get access we have to still approve them after we've got
their documents and id so that's fine hopefully that makes sense too so now let's move on to the
the agents dashboard pretty straightforward four cards total leads active postcodes payment due with
the date that it's due and then any overdue payments with the date that they were meant to be paid
really straightforward and we can also change the leads data to see what the person had yesterday what
they had over the last 30 days and then they can also do a date range so i think that's sorted for
that oh yeah so the padding you don't need that much padding around the um boxes similar to the
dashboard in the admin it can be just that size maybe and four of them that size okay so let's now go on to
the leads section so this is the leads that the assessor will see so bear in mind they're not going
to be using this quite often i don't think because they are meant to be getting a text message and an
email anytime a lead comes in however if they want to or need to they can easily come here they can type in
john and then they can see the lead for john they can click on john they can see when it came in they
can see the postcode they can see the full address in here and if you can add that in based on the
data that comes in from when the person types in the lead they can see the price that we're charging
for the lead um and then just the basic other information so i'd like to add a clear button x button
to clear this so instead of them having to backspace out they can just click the x button and then that
will clear the um search results for the leads and let's say they wanted to now look for someone's
postcode so they've got g1 1xw straight away they can see that that's popped up same with the last one
they've got the information that they can see in here this i button here is to say that there's
additional information so if you can do a hover um status when they hover over there to let them know
not that it's too important but it's just a nice little addition and then we've got the price again
and we also have um yeah i think that's it for that one and what we've got here is we've got leads
over from 30 days can be found in the archive leads and i don't think it makes sense for them to be
having months and months and months worth of leads or on here i think like on this page what we would
have had is just pages and pages and pages and just to me doesn't make sense having it here it
makes sense giving them what they need for 30 days and then after the 30 days getting them to be
archived so they're not just always having to be processed when you come to this page
okay and again they can look at the leads of what they got yesterday look at the lead they got over
the last seven days or look at the leads they got over the last 30 days if they wanted to look through
and they couldn't remember who they saw or what the name they were looking for or if they just wanted
to just see actually how many did they get and how many did they close or go and do work for
okay what we got next
okay so i was just showing you here how the leads look when they're expanded
we've got that okay so now we've got the postcodes so this is where they will add in the postcodes that
they want to um working so here we can see they've got zero active postcodes and zero pause postcodes
so let's say they want to go and work in birmingham so it's similar to the um screen that you've done
for some reason i can't get access into the ad agent um account so i've not been able to use
um i'm not being able to bring that up now to use it as an example to show you why i've created
this design because it's basically just your one so what we've got is the postcodes for birmingham
i can click on birmingham straight away updates to show that we've now got one postcode selected
so they want to do b2 b4 b6 that's fine they want to do one in coventry that's fine and then i want
to do two in wolverhampton so now we can see we've got two three six so we can see six postcodes are
covered in west midlands and then we can see up here six active postcodes so when they come here
from not being on this page they can automatically see straight away they've got six active postcodes and
they know where those postcodes are but let's say they are busy and they won't be able to do
wolverhampton for the next few weeks or months and instead of turning it off or deselecting
they just want to pause them so they can go and pause them wolverhampton will now change to be paused
and then it will show that they've got two paused postcodes so they'll no longer now receive any
um leads for those postcodes because they've technically turned them off but rather than them
having to click and click and click and click to turn off we've made it easy for them for just for
them to just click on pause and then when they're ready again to come back and just click on resume so
now they're no longer paused and they've added those two back to adding postcodes but let's say they don't
know where york is no i won't do york let's say they don't know where preston is and there was around
that area what they can do they can type in preston and then preston will now show the postcodes for
that area just from typing in the word here's the clear button that i wanted you to add on the other
search box so can we just do that click exit then clears it and then let's say they knew
a postcode in liverpool that they wanted to go and do they can type in l
two and then liverpool postcodes will pop up so it's just another quick way for them to just get
to what they want to do select in liverpool wonderful pausing liverpool wonderful quite
straightforward quite easy um and really useful for the end user
so again i've just put the screenshots of it expanded just to show you here so now we've got
the um what do you call it the billing page for the agent so we can see the current period we can see the
spend so far and then the limit press show that they've got set and then we can see how many leads
they've got in this period we've got total due and we've also got outstanding balance and how many
invoices the outstanding balance is from so here what we've got on the page is the different invoices
the date period we've got how many leads are in that invoice we've got the amount we've got the
status of the invoice and then we've also got a download button for them to download the invoice
really pretty straightforward with this one um not really much for them to understand they come here
they can see their invoice they can see their period date for the invoice they know how many leads was
in the invoice they know how much it was they know whether they've paid haven't paid or when they need
to pay and then they've got a download button to download the invoice if they need to
okay so moving on we've got the agent profile this is where they can upload their photo enter in a bit
about the company you want to limit it to 500 characters if you don't want people to be writing
too much then we've got the company status so these things here aren't
aren't changed by them but it will be shown on the website when the customer views them but it's
just for them to see and understand where they're at what they need to do so they've verified all these
different things over here they're not back registered and then they also can change their display name
on the customer end to either their full name their business name or their business name and their name
so really easy really straightforward um page is pretty self-explanatory of what's on here
we've got the different services that they can go and tick that they want to do or are doing
and then we also have the additional cert offerings that they give again they tip them to show that they
do them they can upload their photos here and they're allowed to upload a max of 10 photos once they've
done that they can click on save and that will save the profile and then if you can just get a
confirmation box just to say saved or that has saved your profile just a quick message just to give them
reassurance that what they've done has been saved
okay what we've got next we've got agent account and pretty straightforward
um i haven't created the agent account that this was a duplicate of the
sorry i have created the agent account page i thought i hadn't
you know i'm messing up i'm tired it's 3am in the morning here um i was right i haven't created a
um agent account page i've created a create an account for an agent but i haven't created a
account page for the agent so with the agent once they've got an account they'll be able to come into
the account section the name last name email address phone number um company name accreditation
number accreditation company i think these apart from the email address and phone number should be all
um fields that can't be changed by them they should be locked and then if they need to they just need
to reach out to us to make a request for a change highly unlikely that people will need to change
but obviously some people change their names some people get married some people change businesses
so in those instances we're happy to change but we need to get them to request permission
and then they're free to change their password if they need to
okay what's next okay so now we're getting on to the landing page so what have we got currently the
landing page looks like this that takes too long as you know it's not as long as it was before it's
much quicker than it was but what we're suggesting is to have a landing page like this but then have the
form like this so when they come to the page we've got the box saying enter your postcode to then get
the list of assessors entering the postcode instead of it taking them to another page the form now appears
here from the drop down they select the postcode they select if it's a residential or commercial they
choose the bedrooms they're adding any additional text if they need to click on continue now the form
changes on the page they don't have to go anywhere they can still see the postcode that they're
searching for they can enter in their name entering their post email address
and entering their phone number what they need to do though is tick this box just to confirm that they
agree to um their details being shared with verified assessors in the area and then they go and click on
get assessor details when they click that they then get taken to the search results page so this is where
we're at now on the search results page we're going to have the four assessors as we only have four
we'll have their name and business name if they want or just business name as they've selected it
we'll have the services what we offer or what they offer um and then they'll have a from price
they'll have a phone number they'll have their email visible and they'll have a view profile button
really straightforward really clean really minimal aesthetics nothing too confusing for the customer
to do when they get here and then we've also got at the top of the page just an explanation of
what actually happens view so each assessor is verified and experience click view profile to learn more
about the services and book your assessment really easy really user friendly um and that's wonderful
so um as you mentioned at the start these assessors are now meant to be getting emails every time they
are shown in this way we haven't spoke about that process yet you haven't told us what we need to do
in terms of do we need to buy anything is it mailchimp is it another process do we need to get the sim card
or the automation to send the sms so if possible can you just go over that as well um please
okay so now what the um user's doing on here sorry the customer's doing is having a look
they see this guy here they like the name of energy certs so what they can do is go and call them with
the one two email them with the one two or they're not too sure yet so they want to go view profile
so they can click view profile it will then take them over to their energy sorry to the assessor's
profile page have a photo of them have the name of the business if they wanted it name and business
if they wanted it or just the name if that's what they chose we'll have the postcode that they're
covering sorry it will have the postcode that the customer searched in as the main postcode and then
it will also say and surrounding areas we'll have the number email from price these things here such
as services what we offer about us and then the information that was on the company profile will
be pulled over to this page and will be visible for the customer to see and know that the assessor has
had all these things checked by us to give them the comfort trust and reassurance that they are
rarefied and reputable companies who are going to be doing the assessments bottom of the page we've got
a portfolio section for images that the assessor wants to put up they can swipe through and then
they can click on them if they want to enlarge them and also swipe through at this level so i think
let me just check to the assessor page assessor page profile page okay yeah so i think that is
everything there um hopefully i've made it clear enough for you to see everything um appreciate all the
help that you've been giving us so far um i'm just looking forward to just getting it finished now
getting it over the line getting you guys paid and then we can move forward happy days for everyone
so thank you very much um dowd and the rest of the team hopefully we can just get this sorted now
and we've removed any miscommunication along the way because i've done this video and i will also send
you over the word document and you can also ask me any questions if there's any gaps from my explanation
my demonstration and what you need to do for me and i'm also available to send you over any code for
any of the pages so i made this in react so i don't know if that's what you've used but anything that you
do use if you aren't using what i've created in and you need me to go and create it i can go and create it
for you and then you can just plug it in if you're unable to do it for me um i'm not a developer i'm
not a website developer i'm not a software developer but i've managed to do this with um claude as you
can see so it's not too difficult for me to go and do whatever you don't want to do just to get us
um having the website look how we want here so yeah thank you and i'll speak to you soon
you

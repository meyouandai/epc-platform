# Twilio Call Tracking Implementation Plan

## Overview
Implement bidirectional call tracking to monitor customer-assessor interactions, providing complete visibility into lead conversion and assessor performance.

## Technical Implementation

### Customer Side
- Each assessor gets unique Twilio phone number per lead
- Customer sees: `John Smith - 07700 123456 [Twilio number]`
- Customer calls → Routes to assessor's real number
- Both parties see normal phone experience

### Assessor Side
- Assessors see customer's Twilio number for callbacks
- Routes to customer's real number
- Maintains privacy for both parties

### Call Recording
- Legal announcement: "This call is being recorded for training and quality purposes"
- No pause needed - continue immediately
- Store recordings with lead ID for analysis

## Business Intelligence Data

### Customer Behavior Analytics
- **Proactive vs Passive**: Who calls vs waits for contact
- **Call Patterns**: Which assessors customers prefer calling
- **Patience Metrics**: How long customers wait before giving up
- **Shopping Behavior**: How many assessors they contact

### Assessor Performance Tracking
- **Response Speed**: Time to first contact attempt
- **Contact Rate**: % who actually attempt contact
- **Success Rate**: % who successfully connect
- **Follow-up Patterns**: Persistence and timing
- **Conversion Rate**: Calls that lead to bookings

### Lead Quality Scoring
- **Hot Leads**: Customer called multiple assessors
- **Warm Leads**: Some engagement from either party
- **Cold Leads**: No contact attempted
- **Fraud Detection**: No calls = suspicious pattern

## AI Analysis Implementation

### Call Analysis Features
- **Sentiment Tracking**: Customer satisfaction scores
- **Conversion Triggers**: Language that leads to bookings
- **Objection Patterns**: Common customer concerns
- **Professionalism Scoring**: Communication quality
- **Outcome Classification**: Booked/callback/lost

### Text Message Analysis
- **Response Speed**: Average reply times
- **Communication Style**: Effectiveness measurement
- **Follow-up Sequences**: What works vs what doesn't
- **Conversion Optimization**: Best performing message patterns

## Dynamic Pricing Strategy

### Performance-Based Pricing
```
Premium Areas (High conversion)
- W1 Mayfair: £25/lead (90% call rate, 60% conversion)
- EC1 City: £20/lead (85% call rate, 55% conversion)

Standard Areas
- N1 Islington: £15/lead (70% call rate, 40% conversion)

Discount Areas (Need coverage)

```

### Assessor Performance Tiers
- **Platinum**: Fast responders (£30/lead) - premium leads first
- **Gold**: Good performers (£20/lead) - standard pricing
- **Silver**: Slow responders (£12/lead) - discounted rate
- **Bronze**: Poor contact rate (£8/lead) - last priority

## Training Platform Integration

### Course Development
- **"High-Converting Calls Masterclass"**: Analysis of successful calls
- **"First Contact Excellence"**: Optimizing initial interactions
- **"Objection Handling"**: Common customer concerns from recordings
- **"Area-Specific Strategies"**: What works in different locations

### Pricing Model

## Cost Analysis

### Twilio Costs
- Phone numbers: ~£1/month per number
- Call forwarding: ~£0.01-0.05 per minute
- SMS: ~£0.05 per message
